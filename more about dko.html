   <p style="font-size:25px ;color:darkblue">Daniel Kolawole Olukoya (born 15 July 1957) is a Nigerian pastor, scientist and professor. He is the founder and General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries.[1] Olukoya is the first Nigerian scientist to clone genes.[2][3][4]</p>

   <h2 id="life and education"><ins><h2 style="color:darkred ;">life and education</h2></ins>
    <p style="font-size:25px ; color:blue;background-color: white;">Daniel Olukoya was born in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria to Mr. Olukoya, a police officer and Mrs. Olukoya, a trader. He attended St. John's CAC Primary School, in Akure.[5][6]
    
    Later when his family relocated to Lagos, he was enrolled at St. Jude's Primary school, Ebute Metta, from which he graduated.[7][8]
    
    Olukoya then proceeded to Methodist Boys' High School (MBHS), Broad Street, Lagos.[9][10] This is where he became born again. By the time Olukoya graduated from MBHS, he was the best graduating student of his set.
    
   <p style="font-size:25px ; color:blue;background-color: white;"> In 1976, Daniel Olukoya was awarded a scholarship into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study microbiology. He graduated from UNILAG with a first-class degree in microbiology. He was the first person to have achieved a first-class in the course at the university and his G.P.A is still the highest recorded so far (as of February 2010) in that department.[11]

    Soon after graduation, he won a scholarship to have his PhD programme degree in molecular genetics at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. Olukoya earned his PhD in 3 years and then came back to Nigeria.[12]
    
    Upon his return to Nigeria, Olukoya joined the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, where his reputation as an exceptional geneticist of African origin became established.</p>  <p style="color:blue ;font-size:25px ;"> Olukoya emerged as an authority in the study of genetics, publishing over 70 scientific papers in a short span.[13][14]
    
    He also taught genetics and was external examiner in a number of universities. He has attended and presented papers at scientific conferences in almost all countries of the world.[15] Olukoya continues to contribute to the field of genetics and biotechnology via the Daniel & Fola Biotechnology Foundation in Nigeria, a registered NGO established to empower Nigerian citizens with modern and contemporary laboratory skills in molecular biology and biotechnology.
    
    Olukoya's father, apart from being a policeman, was also a pastor at the Christ Apostolic Church. Thus, he was raised in a Christian home with Christian beliefs. Olukoya's ministry is heavily influenced by the work of Joseph Ayo Babalola, the founder of the Christ Apostolic Church.[16]
    
    Olukoya is the founder of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministry. The church began in a rented hall on Old Yaba road, Ebute Meta, Lagos, in the early 1990s, but has grown big with branches across Nigeria and abroad. The church owns a tertiary institution, the Mountain Top University, and a football club, MFM FC.[17][18]</p>
